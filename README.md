## Planning Story

In planning for this project, we came together as a team to discuss how we wanted to handle the requirements we were given. We decided that we'd create an online chat room where everyone can talk to one another in real time. We began by working on the API to ensure that all the routes that we wanted were handled correctly. Then we began to work on the client side to make sure everything looked like we wanted it to.
